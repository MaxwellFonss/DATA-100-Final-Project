# Lesotho

This is my final project on Lesotho

## Administrative Subdivisions of Lesotho

This graph depicts the adm1 level districts of Lesotho. The capital city is Maseru, which is also located within the state of Maseru.

These graphs show the adm2 administrative subdivisions of the provinces of Hoek and Quthing. I noticed that unlike adm1 administrative subdivisions, the adm borders seem to have been designed to designate urban areas rather than reflect geographic barriers such as mountains and rivers.

## Administrative Subdivisions of Population

These graphs project my estimated total population for each adm1 layer district by projecting data obtained from a population raster onto simple feature plots. While population predictably decreased with distance from the capital, it was suprising to learn that larger states weren't any less likely to have more or less population than smaller ones. It was also noticeable that the western states in Lesotho contained significantly more population than the eastern states.

To further investigate the relationship between state size and population, I plotted population density over an adm1 layer simple features plot. However, the plot was very similar to population and didn't provide any new insights. This is likely because each state in Lesotho is roughly equal in size in terms of area.
